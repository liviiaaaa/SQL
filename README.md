# SQL
This SQL code is written in SQL Server Management Studio. It contains the creation of tables, functions, stored procedures for working with the database, 
as well as the creation of Data Warehouse, dimensions, analysis and more.

This code was written by me during my internship at Softserve Academy from 01.07.2022 to 27.09.2022. 
Looking at this code, you can see that there is no complete code for creating all the tables in the database, filling them and so on. 
You should understand that we worked on this project as a team and everyone did their part.
Therefore, here I show only my part of the work on creating a database, tables, filling it and writing stored procedures, functions, etc. 
Here is almost everything I did during my internship and everything I learned by doing real tasks.
Besides functions and stored procedures, I also created several reports for DW and created ABC analysis and Cohort analysis. 
ABC analysis I also implemented in SQL Server Reporting Services and Cohort Analysis I visualized in Power BI.
